that mainstream economics is narrow, simplistic, and over

The aim is therefore, to show paths and phases of development that
help to overcome stagnation thresholds and to explore the triggering

Industry 4.0, decarbonization) are only one dimension. Industrial...

This book is published in English that fully reveals why the Bank of

goal, clarified the Bank's responsibility, and supplied a large
monetary base through a quantitative easing policy, inflation
expectations would rise and deflation would be overcome. This book
shows that there is...
