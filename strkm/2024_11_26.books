Amidst concerns about replicability but also thanks to the
professionalisation of labs, the rise of pre-registration, the switch
to online experiments, and enhanced computational power, experimental
economics is undergoing rapid changes. They all call for efficient
designs and data analysis, that is, they require that, given the
constraints on participants' time, experiments provide as rich
information as possible. In this Element the authors explore some
ways in which this goal may be reached.

Which scientific results can we trust? This question has been brought
to the forefront of research in the social sciences in recent years
with the movement towards open science practices and
pre-registration. Systematic replication studies of laboratory
experiments in the social sciences have found that only about half of
the "statistically significant" results published in top journals can
be replicated in the sense that similar results are achieved with new
data. This low replicability may be even lower in studies based on

Guestworker migration has become an increasingly prominent feature
within the economic landscape of the Asia-Pacific. Longstanding
regional disparities have underscored the emergence of fragile
remittance economies where a structural reliance on labour-export has
offered an unsustainable 'fix' for stubborn developmental challenges.
Combining political-economic and Foucauldian frames of analysis, this

<strong>Ende eines Wirtschaftssystems?</strong> Das Wirtschaftssystem
des Kapitalismus wird weltweit kritisiert und zum Teil rigoros
bekaempft, obwohl es in den letzten Jahrzehnten einen betraechtlichen

schrumpfenden Kapitalismus, was so nicht funktionieren kann, denn
Wachstum ist in diesem Wirtschaftssystem zwingend. Immer wieder

The Free and Independent (1949) looks at Parliament from the point of

early history of elections when the franchise was sometimes
considered to be a nuisance rather than a privilege, it traces the
recognition of the value of the franchise primarily because it
secured certain advantages for towns and districts, but also because
it was discovered that a vote could be sold often at a high price. It
then considers the long struggle for reform and looks at the Crown
and the...

the benefits of a Marxist approach to public services and presents
Marxist ideas to examine these services at a micro level. It

Between 839 and 1403 CE, there was a six-century lapse in diplomatic
relations between present-day China and Japan. This hiatus in what is
known as the tribute system has led to an assumption that there was
little contact between the two countries in this period. Yiwen Li
debunks this assumption, arguing instead that a vibrant Sino-Japanese
trade network flourished in this period as Buddhist monks and
merchants fostered connections across maritime East Asia. Based on a
close examination of sources in multiple languages, including

involved, processes and mechanisms, and how it has been experienced
by citizens and consumers, the book offers accounts of the historical
antecedents of neoliberalism in the Nordics as well as studies of

The focus of this book is the processes through which industries and

did its economy grow from the sixteenth century to be a 'Workshop of
the World' by the outbreak of the First World War, only to collapse a
decade later? How and why did the region then become a laboratory for
experiments in state policies to reverse economic decline, policies
that have largely failed? How did the region become transformed...

The digital economy is reinvigorating regulatory competition, yet
little is known about which rules and jurisdictions can effectively
bind companies nor what competitive motivations underlie certain
rules. In addition to purely economic motives, legislators are now
also driving the pursuit of digital sovereignty and the enforcement
of social values in digital spaces. It also remains unclear what
regulatory weight the self-regulation of private companies has in

The admiration of science and technology and the emphasis on
political stability are two sides of the same coin in China.
Therefore, China is more likely to take aggressive measures to
promote or inhibit platform development than the United States and
the European Union. But the uncertainty in the decision-making
process is worrisome and calls for a broader discussion of the

When and how do great and middle powers moderately challenge the
status quo? These compelling questions have largely been overlooked
in International Relations literature, which typically views the
cyclical rise of revolutionary revisionist great powers as an
unchanging aspect of international politics. Conventional thinking
suggests that after peace or major agreements are established, a new
international status quo emerges, provoking major dissatisfied states
to challenge it. Sometimes, these challenges escalate to full-scale
wars or...

Originally published in 1969, this book discusses the growth of
foreign trade between 1600 and 1775 which brought about a commercial
revolution in England. English merchants developed the exchange of
manufactured goods for primary products such as tobacco, sugar,
cotton and silk. A notable feature of these years was the American
orientation of English overseas trade. This expansion of commerce
made a decisive contribution to national economic growth. Its
implications for the economy as a whole and the process of

Payments and financial market infrastructures are vital components of
modern economies, yet they have often been overlooked by economists.
However, any economic exchange, including financial market
transactions, is matched by a payment leg, and the safety,
efficiency, and immediacy of the payment, and the problem of linking

interruptions in payment and settlement systems have immediate and
significant impacts

ad-tech, surveillance capitalism, algorithmic manipulation, and
rising techno-fascism. In light of imminent threats like these, many
technologists are starting to question how what they build is...
